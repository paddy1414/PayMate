 •	Add a bill
•	Edit details e.g. group name, remove a user, change profile picture 
•	View outstanding payments
•	View saving goals created by the group
•	View previous bills 
•	Logout -done

when a user registers, they type in their details, but on the server side, its gonna first run the address insert,

--> if it exists, return a number, if not insert and return a number,
 then finally its gonna insert the user with the number returned, I just have to figure out how to do it code wise

// project update 01.05.17
use local storage/session variables for the addBill, figure out BLOBs to view on screen as per thesis pg25 figure11
sort out JSON parser, in order to pull back list of users that match groupId, as well as other parts (refer to LastOrders)
